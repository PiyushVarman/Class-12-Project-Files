'''6. MENU DRIVEN CODE – TUPLES
AIM : To perform the menu options on a tuple of values read as input.
METHODOLOGY: The menu options are displayed. As per the user’s choice, within each of the
menu options, a tuple is read as input and the appropriate functions are called. The first
menu option, reads a tuple of ‘n’ words, calls a function that takes the tuple as parameter
which checks if each word has all the 5 vowels in any case and returns a tuple of such words.
The second menu option reads a nested tuple having height, weight of ‘n’ persons, calls a
function that takes as parameter, each element of the nested tuple, which calculates the BMI
and returns both the BMI and the result as OBESE /OVERWEIGHT/NORMAL/UNDERWEIGHT.
The returned values are displayed in the main function for each person.
