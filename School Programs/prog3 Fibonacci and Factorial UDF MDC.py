'''3. MENU DRIVEN CODE- NUMERIC
AIM: To write user defined functions and test them with a menu driven code
METHODOLOGY: The factorial computation and generation of Fibonacci series is performed
using 2 user defined functions. A menu is displayed and the userâ€™s choice is accepted. Based
on the choice the appropriate function is executed.
